# Introduction
This repository is an attachment to the [EDM](https://github.com/ivanalaman/EDM) package of the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) software. The goal is a question bank storage location so that users can constantly share and update their assessments (evidence). We advise that when downloading the [EDM](https://github.com/ivanalaman/EDM) package, the graphical interface is used to create your question bank, in order to make it standardized among users and so that the [EDM](https://github.com/ivanalaman/EDM) package can correctly read such files.
